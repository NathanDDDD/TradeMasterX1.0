# Multi-Cryptocurrency Support - Implementation Summary

## Overview
We've successfully enhanced TradeMasterX with robust multi-cryptocurrency trading support. The system now properly supports trading multiple coins, tracking their individual balances, and maintaining a unified portfolio.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Updates
- Modified `portfolio` table to remove the generic `crypto` column
- Created `coin_holdings` table to track individual cryptocurrency balances
- Updated `trades` table to include a `coin` field to identify which cryptocurrency was traded

### 2. Trade Executor Class Enhancements
- Updated to store and track multiple cryptocurrencies
- Updated price tracking to maintain prices for each supported coin
- Enhanced trade execution to specify which coin is being traded
- Modified portfolio calculations to account for all coins

### 3. Master Bot Improvements
- Integrated with the new multi-coin trade executor
- Added a `CoinSelector` class that can use different strategies for selecting which coin to trade:
  - Round-robin (cycles through available coins)
  - Random selection
  - Weighted selection (based on performance)

### 4. Database Migration Tool
- Created a migration script to safely transition from the old schema to the new schema
- Handles moving existing 'crypto' balances to the bitcoin holding in the new structure
- Updates trade history to maintain data integrity

### 5. Web Interface Enhancements
- Updated portfolio endpoint to provide details about all coin holdings
- Modified trade history display to show which coin was traded

## Testing
Testing confirmed that the system now properly:
- Tracks individual balances for multiple cryptocurrencies
- Executes trades for specific coins
- Calculates portfolio value correctly across all holdings
- Rotates between different coins for trading decisions

## Remaining Tasks
1. Create sample price history files for each supported coin
2. Add more sophisticated coin selection strategies based on performance
3. Enhance error handling for coin-specific issues
4. Add visualization support for multi-coin portfolios

## Usage
The system now supports specifying which coins to trade via the `--coins` command-line argument:
```
python main.py --coins bitcoin,ethereum,cardano,dogecoin
```

Default coins are bitcoin, ethereum, and litecoin if not specified.
